# TSP using ACO 
Autors: Mia Marte, Sofia Torres and Stephanie Saenz 
In this assignment we will implementan evolutionary approach to solving the classical Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) using Ant Colony Optimization(ACO) techniques in python. Our objective is to gain a comprehensive understanding of this project, including its formulation, complexity and various solutions. However, we learnt how to be resourceful in all the obstacles that we encountered. To conclude, such a great experience where we learned how to communicate with each other, work together as a team and most importantly learn together.
